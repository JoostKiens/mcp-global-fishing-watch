# CLAUDE.md

This file is the entrypoint for Claude Code working in this repository. Read it first. It points to deeper docs — read those too before touching the areas they cover.

## What this project is

An open-source, npm-published MCP server exposing the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API — vessel search, fishing activity, dark-vessel (SAR) detection, vessel event history, and IUU-risk insights — as LLM-friendly tools. TypeScript, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, Zod validation, STDIO + Streamable HTTP transports.

Full product scope and rationale lives in Linear (project: *Global Fishing Watch MCP*). This file and `docs/claude/` cover **how to build it**, not **what to build** — check Linear for ticket-level scope before starting new work.

## Before you write code

| Code style — functional patterns, error handling, SOLID-for-TS, naming          | [`docs/claude/conventions.md`](docs/claude/conventions.md)   |
| Adding or changing an MCP tool specifically                                     | [`docs/claude/mcp-tools.md`](docs/claude/mcp-tools.md)       |

We follow the [MCP best practices guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/docs/best-practices/), **adapted for a single-process, single-user local/npx tool** rather than the distributed production service it was written for. `architecture.md` has an explicit table of what we adopt, adapt, or deliberately skip (Redis, circuit breakers, Kubernetes autoscaling, etc. are all out of scope here — don't add them "for best practice" without checking that table first).

## Non-negotiable constraints

These aren't style preferences — violating them breaks the app against the real GFW API:

- **4Wings report calls (`get_fishing_activity`, `get_dark_vessel_detections`, `get_vessel_presence`) share one concurrency-limited queue.** GFW allows exactly one report in flight per token. Never call the 4Wings report endpoint directly from a tool — always go through the queue (see `architecture.md`).
- **Date ranges for 4Wings reports are capped at 366 days.** Validate and reject client-side before calling GFW — never silently truncate or auto-chunk.
- **Every tool response that returns GFW activity/detection/insight data includes a `dataCaveats` field.** This isn't optional formatting — it's how we satisfy GFW's attribution terms and the project's "honest gap signalling" principle.
- **Never pass through raw GFW arrays.** Every tool summarizes in code (totals, breakdowns, distinct counts) before returning. If you're tempted to `return gfwResponse.entries` unmodified, stop — see `mcp-tools.md`.
- **The bundled gear-type/vessel-type reference data (`src/reference-data/`) is sourced from live GFW dataset metadata.** Extend it the same way: pull the enum from the relevant dataset's `filters` metadata (see `architecture.md`).
- **EEZ region lookup happens at runtime through `find_region`.** It fetches GFW's own `public-eez-areas/context-layers` endpoint once per process and caches the id+name pairs in-memory for the life of the process (see `architecture.md`). GFW's own region ids are the source of truth here; always resolve region names through `find_region`'s cache.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build       # compile TypeScript
npm run dev          # run with watch mode
npm run start         # run compiled server (STDIO)
npm run start:http    # run compiled server (Streamable HTTP)
npm run lint          # eslint
npm run test           # unit tests (no GFW token required)
npm run test:live       # live API smoke tests (requires GFW_API_TOKEN)
```

## Environment

`GFW_API_TOKEN` is required at startup — see `.env.example`. Get one at https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/tokens.
